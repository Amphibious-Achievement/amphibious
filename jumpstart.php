						<p>At the culmination of Amphibious Achievement’s pilot semester, Achievers brought the program full-circle with a donation to Boston’s Jumpstart program. As a part of the “high expectations, advanced resources, competition, and incentives” model, Achievers competed in academic teams to ratchet up points all semester. As the program ended, the team with the most points had the opportunity to pick a charity of their choice to donate an open-ended $250 grant on behalf of Amphibious Achievement. After researching community service programs in the Boston area, this year’s winning team decided Jumpstart would be their charity of choice. The Amphibious Achievement team then went to Jumpstart’s headquarters on Congress Street to present the giant (but real) check. Mentors and Achievers took a picture with the check and received Jumpstart t-shirts along with a tour of their facilities.</p>

						<p>The Amphibious Achievement team hopes to continue giving back to Boston community programs, like Jumpstart, in the future.</p>
