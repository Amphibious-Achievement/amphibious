It’s 9 a.m. on Sunday morning and the otherwise peaceful Infinite Corridor is electrified by 20 high school and MIT students chanting, “we are Achievers, Amphibious Achievers!”

The chant has become a trademark of Amphibious Achievement, a dual athletic and academic mentorship program that brings 18 high school students from the John D. O’Bryant School in Boston to MIT every Sunday. The goal of the program is to promote “success in and out of the water” through aquatic sports, generally inaccessible to inner-city high school youth, and through SAT-based tutoring.
