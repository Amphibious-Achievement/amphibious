In the spring of 2010, MIT students started Amphibious Achievement, a dual athletic and academic mentorship program for high school students in the Boston-Cambridge area. Since that time, they have been impacting the lives of local teens with a mind-body approach to learning.

The program runs every Sunday morning from 9:00 a.m.–1:00 p.m. on MIT’s campus.
