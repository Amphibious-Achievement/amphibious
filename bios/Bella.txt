Bella was born in Brookline, grew up in Weston, and is known as the youngest Caballero. She attends Colgate University, and has a passion for diseases, pandemics and global health issues. When she's not reading about AIDS or dengue fever, Bella enjoys photography with her camera, affectionately named Tyrone. Bella and Tyrone love spending their Sunday mornings with Amphibious Achievement documenting both the academic and athletic portions. In Spring 2011, Bella was among 45 students selected to go to the State House to meet with Governor Deval Patrick about education reform, and she advocated for the support of programs like Amphibious Achievement. Bella's hobbies include playing tennis and lacrosse, running, reading Poe, complaining about the impending water crisis, watching FC Barcelona play and drawing aquatic critters on the margins of her calculus notes.
