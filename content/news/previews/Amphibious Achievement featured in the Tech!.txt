“Success in and out of the water.” That is the motto of Amphibious Achievement, an MIT service group established last January that aims to promote success for area high-schoolers through athletic training, specifically in crew and swimming, and academic instruction, with a focus on college prep in a way that is fun and innovative. The program runs on Sundays from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. during the school year on campus.

MIT juniors Noam Angrist ’13 and Ron Rosenberg ’13 founded the program based on their own experiences that the tools necessary to succeed in athletics - hard work, dedication, perseverance, and resilience - are the same tools needed to succeed in academics.
