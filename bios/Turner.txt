Turner was born in Annapolis, Maryland but has spent most of his life growing up in the suburbs of Boston.  During high school he rowed in the school's crew program for three years before heading to MIT, where he found an urge to bring crew back into his life.  Simultaneously his stepdad, James Tanton, infected him with an interest in teaching.  Amphibious Achievement has come to fill both those wants.

Turner spends much of his time working for a software startup in San Francisco.  His particular joys are juggling, sailing, and reading whenever he has the time.
