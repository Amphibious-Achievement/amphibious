Most teenagers live in the moment. For them, college is far off into the future. When college does draw near their parents often do the worrying. Valdwin Etienne, a sophomore at the John D. O’Bryant School in Boston, stands apart from her peers in this regard. Her parents, originally from Haiti, have little experience with the typical American college admissions process. Valdwin has had no choice but to take the initiative.

Etienne recently signed herself up for Amphibious Achievement, a dual athletic and academic mentorship program that brings high school students from the O’Bryant school to MIT on Sundays to work with MIT student mentors.
