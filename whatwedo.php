				<div class="blurb">
				Whether it's in the pool or on the river, Amphibious Achievers of all levels become successful swimmers and rowers. With all the resources of MIT’s professional athletic facilities and the direction of experienced and motivated coaches, our Achievers learn to excel as true athletes.
				</div>
				<div class="blurb">
				The athletic portion of Amphibious Achievement runs every Sunday from 9:00am-10:30am.  Swimmers are taken to the Olympic-sized aquatic facilities at the Zeisger Center on MIT’s  campus, while rowers are taken to MIT’s Division I Pierce Boathouse.  Our MIT student coaches focus on developing technical skills early on in the program through unconventional drills. Rowers, for example, learn the basics of rowing posture and body swing via rocking back and forth on an ergometer to the rap song “Lean with it, Rock With it.” At the same time, swimmers learn body alignment through static and dynamic yoga exercises out of the water. Later into the program, the focus switches to stamina training, culminating in competitive relays that build on acquired technical skills and push the athletes both physically and mentally.
				</div>
				<div class="blurb">The same coaches that train the athletes in the morning are tutors in the afternoon. This consistency builds strong mentor-mentee connections between the MIT students and the participating student-athletes.

				In the classroom, MIT student tutors work with the Achievers to improve their critical reading techniques, math problem solving skills and grammar comprehension. Utilizing innovative teaching techniques and advanced resources, Achievers become stronger and more confident students.
				</div>
				<div class="blurb" style="margin-left: 30px">
				The academic portion of Amphibious Achievement runs every Sunday from 11am-12:30pm. All Achievers and tutors convene after the morning athletic portion in the academic tutoring room 2-131, located in MIT's infinite corridor. There, after a hearty lunch to reenergize, everyone delves into the lesson material for the day within small tutoring groups.
				</div>
				<div class="blurb" style="margin-left: 30px">
				Each day’s lesson plan is full of interactive and advanced coursework, including:
				<ul>
					<li><span class="subtopic">The Economist</span> | tutors work one-one with students to synthesize and the present Economist articles to the class, making connections to the outside world</li>
					<li><span class="subtopic">YouTube Videos</span> | combine complicated math concepts with pop culture, such as the video "Teach Me How to Factor"</li>
					<li><span class="subtopic">Fun math logic puzzle</span> | One of our tutors, Turner Bohlen, works with Achievers to think about mathematical concepts in unconventional terms</li>
					<li><span class="subtopic">Grammar Jeopardy</span> | students compete in teams to revise sentences on the board and then explain their work for equal credit, in the shortest amount of time</li>
